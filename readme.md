###Winter Show To-Do
- Implement controls for start / end experience fade in / out  
- Implement visuals for 2 pulses  
- Implement pulse reading calibration  
-- read for 5 seconds  
-- find average  
-- find find threshold for pulse  


 
###Next Steps for Sketch
- create background that fades colors
- create "smoke rings" effect
- create circle "wobble"

###Next Steps for Sensor
- Get better pulse readings
- Get temperature readings 


###Main Feedback from User Tests
- Not sure if pulse / breathing is affecting the visuals
- Visuals brightness too harsh 
- Expecting more complexity in terms of visuals 
- Like / dislike colors
